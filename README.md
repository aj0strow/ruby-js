# ruby-js

If you're familiar with programming in ruby, sometimes it's hard to work with other languages. My goal with this is to implement every method of Array and go from there!

Docs will be a long time coming... however a checklist:

Object
- class

Enumerator:
- ::new
- each
- each\_with_index
- with_object & each\_with\_object\_
- next
- next_values

Array:
_(Haven't figured out how to do enumerators yet, so it will return actual array)_
- ::new
- at
- clear
- map & collect
- compact
- concat
- count
- cycle
- drop
- drop_while
- each _(can't break to return nil)_
- each_index

*new* in Array:
- append (think of it as concat!)
