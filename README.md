# ruby-js

If you're familiar with ruby, sometimes when you're working in other languages you miss it. My goal with this is to implement every method of Array and go from there!

Docs will be a long time coming... however a checklist:

Object
- class

Enumerator:
- ::new
- each
- next
- next_values
- peek
- peek_values
- with_index & each\_with\_index
- with_object & each\_with\_object
- to_a

Array:
- ::new
- at
- clear
- compact
- concat
- drop
- drop_while
- each _(can't break to return nil)_
- each_index

*new* in Array:
- append (think of it as concat!)

Enumerable:
- all
- any
- count
- cycle
- detect & find
- each_cons
- each_slice
- flat_map & collect\_concat
- find_index
- first
- select & find_all
- group_by
- include & member
- map & collect
- take
