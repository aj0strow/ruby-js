# ruby-js

If you're familiar with ruby, sometimes when working in other languages something feels missing. My goal with this is to implement every method of Array and go from there!

Docs will be a long time coming... however a checklist:

Object
- class

Enumerator:
- ::new
- each
- next
- next_values
- peek
- peek_values
- with_index & each\_with\_index
- with_object & each\_with\_object
- to_a

Array:
- ::new
- at
- clear
- compact
- concat
- drop
- drop_while
- each _(can't break to return nil)_
- each_index

*new* in Array:
- append (think of it as concat!)

Enumerable:
- all
- any
- count
- cycle
- detect & find
- each_cons
- each_slice
- each_with\_index
- each_with\_object
- flat_map & collect\_concat
- find_index
- first
- select & find_all
- group_by
- include & member
- inject _(not reduce)_
- map & collect
- none
- one
- partition
- reject
- reverse_each
- take
